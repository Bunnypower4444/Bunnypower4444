hi there! I'm Bunnypowerüê∞üêáüê±üêà
<br>
<br>
oh my god why did a write a whole freaking essay
<br>
<br>
* I am a 9th grader from (upstate) New York
* Bunnies and cats are cool
* I love playing music‚ÄìI play the flute and piano, and I am in the Front Ensemble/pit for marching band
* I like to code games
* My favorite language is C#, but I also use JavaScript, Java (sometimes), Python (for quick terminal programs)~~, and Lua (for Roblox)~~
* USACO Bronze

### Some of my projects
* [Synthsizer!](https://github.com/Bunnypower4444/Celeste64Mod/) (not finished though, but the main thing i'm doing right now)
* A [Celeste 64 Mod](https://github.com/Bunnypower4444/Celeste64Mod/) with a bunch of my random ideas and levels
* [Celeste 64 Pacer Test](https://github.com/Bunnypower4444/Celeste64Mod/tree/pacer-test): Celeste 64 mod that adds the FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test
* [CelesteTAS64](https://github.com/Bunnypower4444/CelesteTAS64): A TAS tool for Celeste 64 (I know there already is one that is much better but whatever)
* My [p5.js projects](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/)‚ÄìHere are some of my best projects, in chronological order (don't expect quality from these, they're pretty old lol):
    * [Carrot Clicker](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/PjkfQcgxi)
    * [Pok√©mon](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/sSI3RdZwc)
    * [Piano Tiles Game](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/XWPITbYsW): Piano Tiles but with an actual piano
    * [p5.js Sketch Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/dYCh0X9bd): A program that lets you design p5.js sketches
    * [Chess](https://editor.p5js.org/Bunnypower/sketches/eUCqK3vtv): Chess, made along with my friend [Cole](https://github.com/cole-bechtel/) (NOTE: The computer does not work, it **will** crash the game!)
    * The rest are mainly test projects (and things for Coding Club), but feel free to check them out as well!
    * I also have a Chinese Chess/Xiangqi game that I made using p5.js (but not using their website) but I keep forgetting to upload it
* [Circuit Simulation](https://bunnypower4444.github.io/projects/circuit-simulator/index.html): A digital logic simulation inspired by Sebastian Lague (might not work, unfinished)
* My ["website"](https://bunnypower4444.github.io/index.html) (if you can even call it one) which has a few of my things (honestly i forgot it existed)

### What I'm working on
* Modding Celeste 64 and improving the TAS tool
* A 3D matrix transformation visualizer
* A music game
* I have ideas for a platformer game but I haven't started yet
